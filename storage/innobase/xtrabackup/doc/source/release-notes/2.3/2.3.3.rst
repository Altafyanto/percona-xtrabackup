Bugs fixed
----------

 Database directories were not removed if ``DROP DATABASE`` happened during the
 backup. Bug fixed :jirabug:`PXB-432`.

 Backup would fail if :ref:`storing_history` feature was enabled and backup was
 taken from server without binary log enabled. Bug fixed :jirabug:`PXB-441`.

 |Percona XtraBackup| now fails with descriptive error message if
 :option:`--defaults-extra-file` is not specified first. Bug fixed

 temporary folder. Bug fixed :jirabug:`PXB-444`.

 Bug fixed :jirabug:`PXB-445`.

 :option:`--move-back` did not respect the :option:`innodb_log_group_home_dir`
 and :option:`innodb_data_home_dir` options which caused ``ib_logfiles`` and

 incremental backups. Bug fixed :jirabug:`PXB-448`.

 in the defaults file. Bug fixed :jirabug:`PXB-736`.

 Fixed build issues by adding missing check in ``cmake`` script for ``xxd``
 presence. Bug fixed :jirabug:`PXB-737`.
